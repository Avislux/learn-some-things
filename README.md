#Work-in-progress NodeJS application for learning

Currently hosted at <http://learn-some-stuff.herokuapp.com> (I plan on changing the name)

I started this project as a way to learn NodeJS, Bootstrap 4 and Japanese. The styling is still very minimal. 

I may add features such as Mandarin, Kanji, and Hangul.
